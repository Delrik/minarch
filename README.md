# Description

View all your artifacts progress, and solve them in one compact frame. Also you can view all your artifact history neatly sorted by race, and a list of dig sites. You can left-click the keystone button to attach keystones (or right-click to remove), or if you prefer there are options to automatically use keystones! You can monitor the artifacts progress, or how close you are to the fragment cap.

## Latest Version: v8.2.1
**Make sure to exit the game before/after updating addons.**

- All Window states are now remembered upon relog/reload, unless the "Always start hidden" option is enabled
